# TouchScreenAPI_Examples

Some example apps using TouchScreenAPI

- Navigate to `Data/Scripts/Lima` folder to see the relevant code
- The api folder is a copy of the `TouchScreenAPI` that should come from the mod, always copy the latest version to your mod
- `UiSampleTSS.cs` is the script that shows how to use the `TouchUiKit`, the `SampleApp.cs` is used as example
- `TouchSampleTSS.cs` is a simpler example that only uses `TouchScreenAPI` for cursor and click features, no fancy ui elements
